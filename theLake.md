## The Lake

*In spring of youth it was my lot<br>
To haunt of the wide world a spot<br>
The which I could not love the less-<br>
So lovely was the loneliness<br>
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,<br>
And the tall pines that towered around.*

*But when the Night had thrown her pall<br>
Upon that spot, as upon all,<br>
And the mystic wind went by<br>
Murmuring in melody-<br>
Then- ah then I would awake<br>
To the terror of the lone lake.*

*Yet that terror was not fright,<br>
But a tremulous delight-<br>
A feeling not the jewelled mine<br>
Could teach or bribe me to define-<br>
Nor Love- although the Love were thine.*

*Death was in that poisonous wave,<br>
And in its gulf a fitting grave<br>
For him who thence could solace bring<br>
To his lone imagining-<br>
Whose solitary soul could make<br>
An Eden of that dim lake.* 

**Edgar Allan Poe**
